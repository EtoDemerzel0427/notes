## Market
* A _derivative_ involves two parties agreeing to a future transaction. Its value depends on (or derived from) the value of other underlying variables.
* A _derivative exchange_ is a market where individuals and companies trade standardized contracts that have been defined by the exchange. Examples are CME and CBOE. Trades are handled by the _exchange clearing house_.
* Some trades take place in the _over-the-counter_ (OTC) market. There would be a _central counterparty_ (CCP) whose responsibility is very similar to the exchange clearing house.

## Derivatives
* **_forward contract_**: An agreement to buy or sell an asset at a certain _future time_ for a certain price. Forward contract is obligatory.
* **_spot contract_**: An agreement to buy or sell an asset almost immediately. Spot contract is obligatory too.
* One of the parties to a contract assumes a *long position* and agrees to *buy* the underlying asset on a certain specified future date for a certain specified price. The other party assumes a *short position* and agrees to *sell* the underlying asset on the same day for the same price.
* **_futures contract_**: Like a forward contract, a futures contract is an agreement between two parties to buy or sell an asset at a certain time in the future for a certain price. **Unlike forward contracts**, futures contracts are normally traded on an exchange. The exchange speicifies certain standardized features of the contract. 
* **_options_**: Options are traded both on exchanges and in the OTC market.
  * A _call/put option_ gives the holder the **right** to buy/sell the underlying asset by a certain date for a certain price.
  * The price in the contract is known as the _exercise price_ or _strike price_. The date in the contract is known as the _expiration date_ or _maturity_.
    > usually the precise expiration date is the third Friday of the expiration month.
  * _American options_ can be exercised **at any time up to** the expiration date, European options can be exercised **only on** the expiration date itself. Most of the options that are traded on exchanges are American.
  * Note that an option gives the holder the right to do something, this means the holder _does not_ have to exercise the right. This distinguishes options from forwards and futures, where the holders are obligated to buy or sell the underlying asset.

## Types of Traders
* **_Hedgers:_**: use derivatives to reduce the risk that they face from potential future movements in a market variable.
* **_Speculators_**: use the derivatives to bet on the future direction of a market variable.
* _**Arbitrageurs**_: take offsetting positions in two or more instruments to lock in a profit. For example, when a future contract is trading for different prices on two different exchanges. Arbitrage opportunities cannot last for long.
