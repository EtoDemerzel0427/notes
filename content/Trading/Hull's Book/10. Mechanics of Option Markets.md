* The payoff properties of options can be found in my blog [期权基础：Call、Put，及其Payoff结构](https://huangweiran.club/blog/option-call-put-payoff/).
* Most index options are European.
* A standard exchange-traded stock option in the United States is an American-style option contract to buy or sell _100 share_ of the stock. This size is convenient because the shares themselves are usually traded in lots of 100.
* All options of the same type (calls or puts) on a stock are referred to as an _option class_. An _option series_ consists of all the options of a given class with the same expiration date and strike price.
* Options are referred to as _in the money_, _at the money_, or _out of the money_. If S is the stock price, and K is the strike price, a call/put option is:
  * in the money, when S > K/S < K.
  * at the moeny, when S = K.
  * out of the money when S < K/S > K.
* The _intrinsic value_ of an option is defined as the value it would have if there were no time to maturity, so that the exercise decision had to be made immediately.
$$
\text{Intrinsic Value(Call)} = \max(S - K, 0)
$$
$$
\text{Intrinsic Value(Put)} = \max(K - S, 0)
$$
* An in-the-money American option must be worth at least as much as its intrinsic value, because the holder has the right to exercise it immediately.
* The total value of an option is the sum of its intrinsic value and its time value.
